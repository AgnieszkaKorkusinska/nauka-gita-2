            <p>I found a love for me Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead I found a girl, beautiful and sweet I never knew you were The someone waiting for me 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love Not knowing what it was I will not give you up this time But darling, just kiss me slow, Your heart is all I own And in your eyes, you're holding mine
                <br> Baby, I'm dancing in the dark With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass, listening To our favourite song When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath But you heard it, darling, You look perfect tonight</p>
            <p>
                Well I found a woman, Stronger than anyone I know She shares my dreams, I hope That someday I'll share her home I found a love, to carry more Than just my secrets To carry love, to carry children Of our own
                <br> We are still kids, but We're so in love Fighting against all odds I know we'll be alright this time Darling, just hold my hand Be my girl, I'll be your man I see my future in your eyes

            </p>
            <p>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass, listening To our favourite song When I saw you in that dress, Looking so beautiful I don't deserve this, darling, You look perfect tonight
                <br>Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, With you between my arms Barefoot on the grass, Listening to our favourite song I have faith in what I see Now I know I have met an angel In person, and she looks perfect I don't deserve this You look perfect tonight
