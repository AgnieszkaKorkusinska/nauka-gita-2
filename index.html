<h1>Perfect</h1>
<h2>Ed Sheeran</h2>
<p>I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were 
The someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, 
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine<br>

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark 
With you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening 
To our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, 
I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, 
You look perfect tonight</p>
